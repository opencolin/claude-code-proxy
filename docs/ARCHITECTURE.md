# Architecture

## Overview

This project exposes a Claude-compatible API surface for Claude Code and forwards requests to Nebius-hosted OpenAI-compatible models.

It also bundles MCP servers under `MCP/` so Claude Code can use local tools alongside the proxy.

## High-Level Flow

```text
Claude Code
  ├─ Claude API request -> Proxy (`POST /v1/messages`)
  └─ MCP stdio -> Bundled MCP servers in `MCP/`

Proxy
  ├─ request conversion: Claude -> OpenAI-compatible payload
  ├─ model routing: text vs vision / small vs medium vs large
  └─ response conversion: OpenAI SSE -> Claude SSE

Nebius
  └─ OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint
```

## Model Configuration

Core environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<nebius-key>
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1
BIG_MODEL=zai-org/GLM-4.5
MIDDLE_MODEL=zai-org/GLM-4.5
SMALL_MODEL=zai-org/GLM-4.5
VISION_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
```

### `/model` aliases

Inside Claude Code, users can type `/model <alias>` to switch upstream models without restarting the proxy or editing `.env`. `ModelManager` resolves the alias on each request, so the choice is stateless from the proxy's perspective.

| Alias | Default upstream | Override env var |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opus` | `BIG_MODEL` | (use `BIG_MODEL`) |
| `sonnet` | `MIDDLE_MODEL` | (use `MIDDLE_MODEL`) |
| `haiku` | `SMALL_MODEL` | (use `SMALL_MODEL`) |
| `glm` | `BIG_MODEL` | `GLM_MODEL` |
| `kimi` | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` | `KIMI_MODEL` |
| `gemma` | `google/gemma-3-27b-it` | `GEMMA_MODEL` |

Aliases match either as the full model id (e.g. `/model glm`) or as a keyword inside a longer id (e.g. `glm-5`, `claude-opus-4-5`). Native ids that begin with `gpt-`, `o1-`, `ep-`, `doubao-`, or `deepseek-` pass through verbatim and bypass the alias table.

### Picker contents (`/v1/models`)

`/v1/models` surfaces three groups, in this order:

1. The short aliases above (`glm`, `kimi`, `gemma`).
2. The full upstream Token Factory catalog, fetched from `{OPENAI_BASE_URL}/v1/models` and cached at module level for `MODELS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 600). On upstream error the listing degrades to whatever was cached, or to just the aliases if nothing has been cached yet.
3. Any extra ids from `BIG_MODEL` / `MIDDLE_MODEL` / `SMALL_MODEL` / `VISION_MODEL` that the upstream catalog didn't already include.

Earlier versions of this listing carried hardcoded `claude-haiku-*`, `claude-sonnet-*`, `claude-opus-*` entries that all silently routed to `BIG_MODEL`. Those have been removed because they were misleading; a follow-up PR will reintroduce curated `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` entries that actually forward to api.anthropic.com.

#### What Claude Code's `/model` picker actually shows

The picker is hardcoded inside the Claude Code binary — items 1–4 are always Default/Sonnet/Sonnet (1M)/Haiku from Anthropic, and the proxy can't replace them. Claude Code consults `/v1/models` only to label the *currently-selected* custom model (it shows up as item 5 once selected). The full Token Factory catalog returned by `/v1/models` is therefore aimed at SDK clients and at making the alias resolution discoverable; it is not enumerated in the picker UI.

To use any catalog id, type it directly: `/model meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`. Claude Code accepts arbitrary `--model` strings and forwards them verbatim, and the proxy routes by id (slash-passthrough for `provider/model` shapes; alias map for short names; catalog ids fall through to the existing routing rules).

## Request Lifecycle

1. Claude Code sends a Claude-compatible request to `/v1/messages`.
2. `request_converter.py` maps the request into OpenAI chat-completions format.
3. Schema-less Claude Code tools are converted into explicit JSON-schema tools.
4. The request is sent to the configured Nebius endpoint.
5. OpenAI-format streaming chunks are received.
6. `response_converter.py` converts them into Claude SSE events.
7. Claude Code receives a native Claude-style response stream.
